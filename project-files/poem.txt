A man ran across the land
looking for himself
The ancient repository hidden there
gathering dust upon the shelf

A broken script
A broken world
Why had the class
No errors hurled?

Stop forking!
Cried the ancient master
Two projects
Surely spells disaster!

SQL injection
We don't want that! Yuck!
But injection was avoided
Hey Guys, We don't suck!
